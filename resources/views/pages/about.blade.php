			<p class="text-center">
				We continue to work on our mission of helping people in pain find natural relief - the first time!
			</p>
			<p>
					After spending over tons of money and time trying to get relief from conditions associated with multiple car wrecks, 
					Amanda Bicknell decided there needed to be an easier way to find natural relief. &nbsp  
					She had tried many different types of care and many different sources on the web to find care, but she saw two key problems in her search 
					- 1) No site allowed people just to search by their pain type (they all required you already to know what kind of provider you wanted) and 
					2) Existing review sites were unreliable because people could pay to get rated better or could flood the site with "fake" reviews. &nbsp 
					So she set out to make the solution she wanted.  <br> <br> She took her idea to Startup Weekend KC and not only was she able to attract people who
					were interested in the problem, the idea even attracted the attention of a couple of the mentors that decided to join the team.  &nbsp 
					At the end of Startup Weekend Heal the Onion placed second out of 10 teams! &nbspAfter Startup 
					Weekend the team fluctuated a bit with new members signing on and some of the original crew departing, but after a month or so - Amanda, Nick and Chris 
					continued to develop the idea into a full fledged startup.<br><br>

			<p class="text-center" style="font-family:'Open Sans';font-size:16px; margin:10px">
					Our mission is to make alternative care easier to understand and easier to access, by helping you find your relief - the first time. <br> <br>
					This means we strive to clearly identify what providers are best for what conditions – to ensure that people in pain find the providers best 
					able to help them and that providers receive patients that they are best suited to help. &nbsp We make the whole process simple, trustworthy 
					and reliable – just like it would be if you were finding a natural healer through word of mouth from a trusted friend.&nbsp  
					You are an important part of accomplishing this mission.  &nbspIf you are a member you know what works best for you and by sharing your 
					experience, you are helping literally thousands of other people find the best alternative care for their pain.  &nbspIf you are a provider, 
					you know who you are best suited to help and can share additional information on your modalities to help people feel more comfortable coming 
					to you for care.<br>
					We'll accomplish our mission by helping you find your relief - the first time!

				Nick's Story
			</h3>
			<p class="text-center">
				I was drawn to this startup because I have experience on both sides of the Alternative healing equation. &nbsp 
				On one side I have a ruptured disk in my back that was operated on years ago.  &nbsp I continue to work and live, but I 
				experience chronic lower back pain relating to this injury and have sought out different kinds of pain relief from 
				massage to acupuncture.  &nbsp I know how hard it can be to find the right provider to help you get relief. <br> <br>
				On the other side of the equation, my wife is a licensed massage therapist, a yoga instructor and a herablist and I 
				know how hard it has been for her in starting her business and attracting clients that she is best suited to help. &nbsp
				She is active in the natural healing community and we frequently talk about how to better reach people who could
				benefit the most from her skills.
