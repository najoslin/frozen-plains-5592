		We continue to work on our mission of helping people in pain find natural relief - the first time!
		<br>
		<br>
		After spending over tons of money and time trying to get relief from conditions associated with multiple car wrecks, 
		Amanda Bicknell decided there needed to be an easier way to find natural relief. &nbsp  
		She had tried many different types of care and many different sources on the web to find care, but she saw two key problems in her search 
		- 1) No site allowed people just to search by their pain type (they all required you already to know what kind of provider you wanted) and 
		2) Existing review sites were unreliable because people could pay to get rated better or could flood the site with "fake" reviews. &nbsp 
		So she set out to make the solution she wanted.  <br> <br> She took her idea to Startup Weekend KC and not only was she able to attract people who
		were interested in the problem, the idea even attracted the attention of a couple of the mentors that decided to join the team.  &nbsp 
		At the end of Startup Weekend Heal the Onion placed second out of 10 teams! &nbspAfter Startup 
		Weekend the team fluctuated a bit with new members signing on and some of the original crew departing, but after a month or so - Amanda, Nick and Chris 
		continued to develop the idea into a full fledged startup.<br><br>

		<p style="font-family:'Open Sans';font-size:16px; margin:10px">
		Our mission is to make alternative care easier to understand and easier to access, by helping you find your relief - the first time. <br> <br>
		This means we strive to clearly identify what providers are best for what conditions – to ensure that people in pain find the providers best 
		able to help them and that providers receive patients that they are best suited to help. &nbsp We make the whole process simple, trustworthy 
		and reliable – just like it would be if you were finding a natural healer through word of mouth from a trusted friend.&nbsp  
		You are an important part of accomplishing this mission.  &nbspIf you are a member you know what works best for you and by sharing your 
		experience, you are helping literally thousands of other people find the best alternative care for their pain.  &nbspIf you are a provider, 
		you know who you are best suited to help and can share additional information on your modalities to help people feel more comfortable coming 
		to you for care.<br>
		We'll accomplish our mission by helping you find your relief - the first time!</p>
